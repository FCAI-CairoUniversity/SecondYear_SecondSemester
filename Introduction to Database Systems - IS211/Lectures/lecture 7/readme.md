# SQL Operations - UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT & Aggregate Functions

## Overview
This document covers essential SQL operations such as **UNION**, **UNION ALL**, **INTERSECT**, and **EXCEPT** along with **aggregate functions** and **subqueries** using the `university` database.

## Table Structure
Before using these operations, ensure you have the following tables in your database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
    SSN INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    Major VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Course (
    CrsCode INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Registered (
    SSN INT,
    CrsCode INT,
    Semester VARCHAR(20),
    Year INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (SSN, CrsCode, Semester, Year),
    FOREIGN KEY (SSN) REFERENCES Student(SSN) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (CrsCode) REFERENCES Course(CrsCode) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE Department (
    DeptCode INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

## ðŸ”¹ UNION vs. UNION ALL
### ðŸ”¹ `UNION` - Removes Duplicates
Combines result sets from multiple queries but **removes duplicates**.
```sql
SELECT Name FROM Student
UNION
SELECT Name FROM Course;
```

### ðŸ”¹ `UNION ALL` - Keeps Duplicates
Combines result sets but **keeps duplicates**.
```sql
SELECT Name FROM Student
UNION ALL
SELECT Name FROM Course;
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ INTERSECT
Returns only **common values** from both queries.
```sql
SELECT Name FROM Student
INTERSECT
SELECT Name FROM Course;
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ EXCEPT
Returns values that are in the first query but **not in the second**.
```sql
SELECT Name FROM Student
EXCEPT
SELECT Name FROM Course;
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions perform calculations on a group of values and return a **single** value.

### âœ… COUNT() - Counting Rows
Counts the number of students in the database.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(SSN) AS Student_Count FROM Student;
```

### âœ… SUM() - Total Sum
Finds the total number of courses registered.
```sql
SELECT SUM(CrsCode) FROM Registered;
```

### âœ… AVG() - Average
Finds the average age of students.
```sql
SELECT AVG(Age) AS Average_Age FROM Student;
```

### âœ… MAX() & MIN() - Maximum and Minimum Values
Finds the oldest and youngest student.
```sql
SELECT MAX(Age) AS Oldest_Student, MIN(Age) AS Youngest_Student FROM Student;
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ GROUP BY & HAVING

### âœ… GROUP BY - Grouping Results
Groups students by major and counts the number of students in each major.
```sql
SELECT Major, COUNT(*) AS Student_Count
FROM Student
GROUP BY Major;
```

### âœ… HAVING - Filtering Grouped Data
Finds majors with more than one student.
```sql
SELECT Major, COUNT(*) AS Student_Count
FROM Student
GROUP BY Major
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Subqueries
Subqueries are nested queries used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query.

### âœ… Subquery in `WHERE` Clause
Find students who are registered in any course.
```sql
SELECT Name FROM Student
WHERE SSN IN (SELECT SSN FROM Registered);
```

### âœ… Subquery in `SELECT` Clause
Find each student's number of registered courses.
```sql
SELECT Name, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Registered WHERE Registered.SSN = Student.SSN) AS Course_Count
FROM Student;
```

### âœ… Subquery in `FROM` Clause
Find the average age of students per major using a subquery.
```sql
SELECT Major, AVG(Age) AS Average_Age
FROM (SELECT * FROM Student) AS Subquery
GROUP BY Major;
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
- Test these queries in **Microsoft SQL Server**.
- Modify them to fit your database.
- Experiment with different conditions to understand their behavior.
